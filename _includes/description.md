*When:* Sat Dec 8th 08:00 AM &mdash; 06:30 PM

*Where:* Palais des Congrès de Montréal, Montréal, Canada

Machine learning open source software (MLOSS) is one of the cornerstones of open science and reproducible research. Once a niche area for ML research, MLOSS today has gathered significant momentum, fostered both by scientific community, and more recently by corporate organizations. Along with open access and open data, it enables free reuse and extension of current developments in ML.
