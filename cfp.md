The organizing committee is currently seeking abstracts for talks and demos that showcase novel and exciting Machine Learning Open Source Software (MLOSS). The workshop is a great opportunity for you to share use-cases, development, philosophy, or other activities related to MLOSS. Smaller projects and those without a significant supporting organization are especially encouraged to participate for improved outreach and visibility.

Possible topics include (but not exclusively):
- Position papers for community growth/transition/diversification
- Retrospectives on community/funding/sustainability experiences
- Real-world use-cases of MLOSS
- Novel or improved ML packages
- Meta projects that connect third party projects, e.g. benchmarking, workflows, wrappers, etc

The committee will select several submitted abstracts for demos and short talks. All software presentations are required to include a live demonstration.

Submission format is [NIPS'18 style pdf](https://nips.cc/Conferences/2018/PaperInformation/StyleFiles) (3 pages maximum + references). All submissions must include pointers to project website/community, code (GitHub, etc), where applicable. For software submissions, a link to code is mandatory. Previews of to be presented demos are not mandatory but will increase the acceptance likelihood. The submissions are not required to be anonymous. Please submit your contributions using [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=NIPS.cc/2018/Workshop/MLOSS).

Please note that there is a separate pool of NIPS tickets for those who present at workshops. For more details see [FAQ](/faq).
