The organizing committee is currently seeking abstracts for talks and demos that showcase novel and exciting MLOSS. The workshop is a great opportunity for you to share use-cases, development, philosophy, or other activities related to MLOSS. Smaller projects and those without a significant supporting organization are especially encouraged to participate for improved outreach and visibility.

Possible topics include (but not exclusively):
- Position papers for community growth/transition/diversification
- Retrospectives on community/funding/sustainability experiences
- Real-world use-cases of MLOSS
- Novel or improved ML packages
- Meta projects that connect third party projects, e.g. benchmarking, workflows, etc

The committee will select several submitted abstracts for demos and short talks. All software presentations are required to include a live demonstration. 

Submission format is NIPS'18 style pdf (3 pages maximum). All submissions must include pointers to project website/community, code (GitHub, etc), where applicable. For software submissions, a link to code is mandatory. Previews of to be presented demos are not mandatory but will increase the acceptance likelihood. Please submit your contributions at [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=NIPS.cc/2018/Workshop/MLOSS).
