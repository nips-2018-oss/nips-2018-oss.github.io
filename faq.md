## NIPS 2018 tickets sold out in 11 minutes and I didn't get a ticket. Why should I bother to send in a proposal when I cannot attend?
There is a separate/reserved pool of tickets for presenters at the conference/workshops. If your contribution gets accepted, you will definitely have a chance to get a ticket and attend.

## Is there any sponsorship available to attend the workshop?
We have limited resources to support student travel. We will try to make sure that anybody who has a good contribution gets a chance to present at the workshop. [Apply here](https://goo.gl/forms/8U9N4NXugUH69jKj2).
