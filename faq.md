## NIPS tickets are sold out in 11 minutes, why should I bother to send in a proposal when I cannot attend?
Speakers of the conference/workshop have a separate/reserved pool of tickets. Hence, if your contribution gets accepted, you will definitely have the chance to get a ticket and attend.

## Is there any sponsorship available to attend the workshop?
Although we have limited resources available, but we will try to make sure that anybody who has a good contribution, has the chance to present their work at the workshop.
