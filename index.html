Machine learning open source software (MLOSS) is one of the cornerstones of open science and reproducible research. Once a niche area for ML research, MLOSS today has gathered significant momentum, fostered both by scientific community, and more recently by corporate organizations. The past mloss.org workshops, from NIPS'06 to ICML'15, successfully brought together researchers and developers from both fields, to exchange experiences and lessons learnt, to encourage interoperability between people and projects, and to demonstrate software to users in the ML community.

Continuing the tradition in 2018, this year’s workshop that is a mix of invited speakers ([NumFOCUS](https://numfocus.org), [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), [openML](https://www.openml.org/), [GPFlow](https://gpflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)), contributed talks/demos, and discussion/activity sessions. This year’s headline aims to give an insight of the challenges faced by projects as they seek long-term sustainability, with a particular focus on community building and preservation, and diverse teams. See [Call for Participation](/cfp) for submission details.
